This is an assignment from udacity
a data structure established to view and navigate movie trailers
a class called "movie" in a file called "media.py" was created and given several arguments
 -title -storyline -poster image -youtube trailer
 we also wrote a method for this class called "show_trailer" that would open a browser 
 go to the youtube trailer argument 
 
 
 a separate file was created and called "ent_center.py"
 in this file we created several instances of the "Movie" class we created in the "media.py" file and entered their respective data
 to match the classes arguments
 we also created an array called "movies" containing the instances of the Movie class we created in the same file
 we then called a function from the file "fresh_tomatoes" called open_movies_page and gived it the "movie" we created
 this then created an html that displayed the intances of the Movie class we created and allowed us to see their trailers
