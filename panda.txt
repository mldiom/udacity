I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and shit, sippin' Fanta

Wake up Versace shit, life Desiigner

White X6, killin' on camera
Pop a Perc, I can't stand up
Gorilla, they come and kill you with bananas
Four fillas, they finna pull up in the Phantom

Countin' to the chicken
And all of my niggas gon' split it
